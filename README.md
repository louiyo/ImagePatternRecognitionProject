# IAPR-project

## Course Goal
Gain foundational knowledge in digital image interpretation and pattern detection techniques. Topics include image enhancement, object delineation, form characterization, and categorization. Real-world use cases in visual computing and healthcare imaging will be used to demonstrate these principles.

## Repository Purpose
This repository hosts the course project materials related to the EPFL graduate-level class EE-451 on image interpretation and pattern classification, done in 2023
The data was not pushed to keep the repository light but the jupyter notebook outputs contains some examples and results.
